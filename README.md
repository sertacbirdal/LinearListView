LinearListView
=================

Android library that allows you to bind a `LinearLayout` with a `ListAdapter`.


Download
--------

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.frankiesardo:linearlistview:1.0.1@aar'
}
```

Usage
=====

A simple example of the xml attributes that you can use

```xml
<com.linearlistview.LinearListView
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/list"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    android:showDividers="none|middle|beginning|end"
    android:divider="@drawable/your_divider"
    android:dividerPadding="2dp"
    app:dividerThickness="2dp"
    android:entries="@array/your_array" />
```

Where: `showDividers`, `divider` and `dividerPadding` have the same meaning of a `LinearLayout` (API 11) attributes, `entries` is the same as a `ListView` attribute and `dividerThickness` controls how thick is the divider (namely its height or width depending on its orientation).

In your `Activity` you can call `myLinearListView.setAdapter(myAdapter)` and each view from your `ListAdapter` will be inflated and kept in sync with its data.


Why you want to use a LinearListVew:

* You need an horizontal scrollable list (since `Gallery` is deprecated): Just embed this layout with an `horizontal` orientation in an `HorizontalScrollView`.
* You need two or more lists in a vertical scrollable view.
* You need to inflate several views in a `LinearLayout` from an `Adapter` and you want to keep them synchronized with its data. This is especially useful when working with a `CursorAdapter`.
* You need a list with a fixed height (the total height of its children). Or, you have a complex, scrollable layout and don't want to use a `ListView` with footers and headers.
* You simply want to use a `LinearLayout` with dividers (API 11) with the added benefit of a `dividerThickness` attribute.


Roadmap
-------------------------

* Adding a `drawSelectorOnTop` attribute.
